THIS README IS STILL IN PROGRESS

---------------
RUNNING LOCALLY
---------------

To run a shell:
  python run_program.py [-e ENGINE]

To run a program:
  python run_program.py [-e ENGINE] [-p PROGRAM]

(Flags)
ENGINE:  r = randomdb, t = traces, rt = reduced traces
PROGRAM:  The directory of some Church program.

-----------------------
RUN A SERVER (REST API)
-----------------------

To run the python server:
  python server.py [-e ENGINE] [-v] [-p PORT]

To run a C server:
  python server.py [-s BINARY] [-v] [-p PORT]

(Flags)
ENGINE:  r = randomdb, t = traces, rt = reduced traces
BINARY:  The directory of some C binary
PORT: The number of some port
The -v flag toggles whether the server should print its activity

-----------------------
SETUP ON EC2

-----------------------
CREATING THE C BINARIES
-----------------------


You can also compile a faster version of the server by doing the following:

1.  (OPTIONAL) Open socket_server.py, and change engine_type to what you'd like.
2.  Install pypy.  
3.  Run (replace the path to translate.py as appropriate):
        python /Applications/pypy/pypy/translator/goal/translate.py socket_server.py 
    (NOT YET READY)
    For a tracing JIT version :
        python /Applications/pypy/pypy/translator/goal/translate.py --opt=jit socket_server.py 
     WARNING:  This can take a long time.
4.  This should create a binary called socket_server-c.  You may want to rename it:
     mv socket_server-c some_new_name
